# realsense-apriltag-pose-detector
This repository provides a solution for detecting April tags and estimating their pose.  It leverages Intel Realsense depth camera, ROS2 middleware and Computer Vision libraries to provide pose estimations for Atags in 3D space.

### Features
- Integration with Intel Realsense depth cameras for capturing depth and RGB images.
- Detection of April tags in RGB images.
- Estimation of pose of detected tags in camera frame.
- ROS2 message handling for receiving camera data and publishing pose estimates.
